# <Steven Kravitz's Portfolio>

## Description

This repo is the code layout for the first iteration of my portfolio website. I built this from the ground up during my first week learning to code. This website currently acts as a place for potential employers to view a few of my projects, learn about me, and find where to contact me.

<!-- ## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license) -->

<!-- ## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. -->

## Usage

<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ``` -->
Scroll through the page using the nav bar to quickly jump sections. Discover a picture of myself, and a little description about me. Follow Links to projects I created and collaborated on. Get in contact with me through my email, phone number, or github. If you have any questions about my past work experience, my resume is attached at the bottom as well.
